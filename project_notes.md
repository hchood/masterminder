## Setup

* Create the top-level app directory:

  ```no-highlight
  mkdir masterminder
  cd masterminder
  ```

* Create the ember app inside your app directory.  Rename it `frontend/`.

  ```no-highlight
  ember new masterminder --skip-git --dir=frontend
  ```

* Create the rails-api app using Postgres. Rename it `backend/`.

  ```no-highlight
  rails-api new mastermind -T --database=postgresql
  mv masterminder backend
  ```

* Initialize a git repo in your top-level app directory:

  ```no-highlight
  cd ..
  git init
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial commit."
  ```

* Add `active_model_serializers` gem and testing and debugging gems and bundle. Commit your changes. **Make sure to specify version 0.8.3 for active_model_serializers if you're using Rails 4.2! (which you should be).**

  ```ruby
  # Gemfile

  gem 'active_model_serializers', '0.8.3'

  group :test do
    gem 'shoulda-matchers', require: false
  end

  group :development, :test do
    gem 'factory_girl_rails'
    gem 'faker'
    gem 'pry-rails'
    gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.0.0'
  end
  ```

  ```no-highlight
  cd backend
  bundle install
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Add active_model_serializers, debugging and testing gems."
  ```

* [PROLLY DO THIS STEP LATER] Add a rake task to start up your Rails and Ember apps.

  You should be able to access your Ember app at `http://localhost:4200` once you start the server:

  ```no-highlight
  cd ../frontend
  ember server
  ```

  Your Rails app, meanwhile, can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`

  Let's add a rake task that will start up both those servers from your top-level directory.  Create a `Rakefile` in your top-level directory containing the following:

  ```ruby
  require "rake"

  task :run do
    pids = [
      spawn("cd backend && rails s"),
      spawn("cd frontend && ./node_modules/.bin/ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000"),
    ]

    trap "INT" do
      Process.kill "INT", *pids
      exit 1
    end

    loop do
      sleep 1
    end
  end
  ```

  Now running `rake run` should start up both your rails and ember servers.

## PART 1 - Projects

## View projects

The first thing our wizards want to do is add a world domination scheme.  Let's first test the pages that'll display those schemes.


```no-highlight
As an evil wizard
I want to view a list of all projects
So that I can see all of the world domination schemes

Acceptance Criteria:
* I see links to all of the world domination schemes.
```

### A. Write a test for the ember app

* Create the acceptance test using the ember-cli generator:

  ```no-highlight
  ember generate acceptance-test projects
  ```

  The ember-cli generator generates the following file for us:

  ```js
  // frontend/tests/acceptance/projects-test.js
  import Ember from 'ember';
  import startApp from '../helpers/start-app';

  var application;

  module('Acceptance: Projects', {
    setup() {
      application = startApp();
    },
    teardown() {
      Ember.run(application, 'destroy');
    }
  });

  test('visiting /projects', function() {
    visit('/projects');

    andThen(() => {
      equal(currentPath(), 'projects');
    });
  });
  ```

  This created some setup for our tests, as well as a test that's making sure that once we visit the `/projects` path, we're actually on that path.

  Since we haven't created a route for `/projects` yet, this test should fail.  You can see that by navigating to [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests) (make sure your server is running).  You should see something like:
    ![failing test screenshot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mastermind-ember-tutorial/Screenshot+2015-01-14+21.18.09.png)

    The error tells us we need to create a route, similar if we were to visit a url in a capybara test in Rails where we hadn't started to implement the feature.

    Let's add that route, in the `frontend/app/router.js` file:

    ```js
    Router.map(function() {
      // add this line
      this.route('projects');
    });
    ```

    Now that test should be passing.

* Add more tests.

  In addition to testing that the route exists, we also want to test some other stuff, such as:

  A. that we can navigate to the `/projects` page from the homepage.

  B. that the correct content appears on our `/projects` page.  Specifically, let's test that the page contains links to each project.

  Add the following tests, plus additional setup. Your test file should look like this:

  ```js
  import Ember from 'ember';
  import startApp from '../helpers/start-app';

  // import pretender addon to mock api response
  import Pretender from 'pretender';

  // make server variable available in your tests (if that is indeed what this line does? IDK maybe I should learn javascript someday)
  var application, server;

  module('Acceptance: Projects', {
    setup() {
      application = startApp();

      // create some fake projects for pretender to serve up
      var projects = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Lock up world oil supply' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Tank the U.S. dollar' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Smite the world with plague of man-eating ladybugs' }
      ];

      // use pretender to serve up those fake projects
      server = new Pretender(function(){
        this.get('/api/v1/projects', function(request){
          return [200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"}, JSON.stringify({projects: projects})];
        });
      });
    },
    teardown() {
      Ember.run(application, 'destroy');
    }
  });

  // add some tests!

  test('Should allow navigation to the projects page from the landing page', function() {
    visit('/').then(() => {
      click('a:contains("Projects")');
    });

    andThen(=> () {
      equal(find('h3').text(), 'All World Domination Schemes');
    });
  });

  test('visiting /projects', function() {
    visit('/projects');

    andThen(() => {
      equal(currentPath(), 'projects.index');

      equal(find('h3:contains("All World Domination Schemes")').length, 1);
      equal(find('a:contains("Lock up world oil supply")').length, 1);
      equal(find('a:contains("Tank the U.S. dollar")').length, 1);
      equal(find('a:contains("Smite the world with plague of man-eating ladybugs")').length, 1);
    });
  });
    ```

    There's one other thing we need to do before we can start making our tests pass.  The setup we just added is using an addon called [ember-cli-pretender](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-pretender) to mock a response from the Rails API (which we have yet to build).  To use it, we'll need to add the [ember-cli-pretender]() addon:

  ```no-highlight
  cd frontend
  ember install ember-cli-pretender
  ```

  If we start our server and visit [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests), we should see our failing tests.

  Now let's make the tests pass.

  1. Add link to `/projects` page

    ```js
    // frontend/app/templates/application.hbs

    <h2 id="title">Mastermind</h2>

    {{link-to 'Projects' 'projects'}}

    {{outlet}}
    ```

  2. Add templates for projects index & show pages

    ```js
    // frontend/app/templates/projects.hbs

    <h3>All World Domination Schemes</h3>

    {{outlet}}  
    ```

    [**NOTE:** Eric says you don't need a `projects.hbs` template but couldn't get test to pass w/o it.]

    ```js
    // frontend/app/templates/projects/index.hbs

    <ul>
      {{#each model as |project|}}
        <li>{{link-to project.name 'projects.show' project.id}}</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

  3. Add routes to projects index and show pages in router

    ```js
    // frontend/app/router.js

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('projects', function() {
        this.route('show', { path: ':id' });
      });
    });
    ```

  4. Add route for projects index

    ```no-highlight
    $ ember g route projects/index
    ```

    ```js
    // frontend/app/routes/projects/index.js

    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model() {
        return this.store.findAll('project');
      },
    });
    ```

  5. Add project model:

    ```no-highlight
    $ ember g model project name:string
    ```

    ```js
    // frontend/app/models/project.js
    import DS from 'ember-data';

    export default DS.Model.extend({
      name: DS.attr('string')
    });
    ```
